# Flight-scheduling-optimization
The Flight Schedule Optimizer is a Streamlit-based web application that analyzes and visualizes flight data from both offline Excel datasets and the AviationStack API. The project is designed to assist airlines, airports, and analysts in identifying delays, comparing airline performance, and suggesting optimal scheduling slots.

Project Overview

Airline schedules often suffer from delays and inefficiencies. This tool helps identify:

Which flights and airlines experience the most delays

What time slots are busiest or most efficient

How delays vary across destinations and carriers

Suggestions for optimized scheduling based on delay trends

The system combines offline Excel datasets for testing and live API data for real-time analysis. With its rule-based NLP query engine, it simplifies complex analysis into natural questions.

🚀 Features

📂 Load flight data from Excel or AviationStack API

🧠 NLP query engine: Ask in natural language (“average delay”, “busiest hour”)

📊 Interactive visualizations:

Top 5 delayed flights

Flight distribution by hour

Average delays per airline

Delay trend by time slots

🛠 Automatic data cleaning and imputation for missing or inconsistent values

✅ Optimized schedule suggestions for better planning
